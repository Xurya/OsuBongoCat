# OsuBongoCat
Personal project from September ‎15, ‎2018

Background:
Bongo Cat just became a popular figure at the time, and I decided to create a quick application to automate Bongo Cat for Osu. I finished this project by the end of the same day. I have a lot of improvements in mind (such as creating an executable, swappable pictures, etc.), but I do not use the application anymore.  

Here is a link to the Osu website: https://osu.ppy.sh/home

Here is an example of Bongo Cat (GIF from Tenor):

How to use:
1. Compile and execute the application. 
1.5. Run Osu (Optional)
2. Press x and z to trigger animation in real time.
